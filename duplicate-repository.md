The [repository](https://github.com/source-ag/assignment-software-engineering) for the assignment
is public and Github does not allow the creation of private forks for public repositories.

The correct way of creating a private frok by duplicating the repo is documented
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/).

For this assignment the commands are:

1.  Create a bare clone of the repository.
    (This is temporary and will be removed so just do it wherever.)

    ```bash
    git clone --bare git@github.com:source-ag/assignment-software-engineering.git
    ```

2.  [Create a new private repository on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) and give it a good name, for example `source-assignment-software-engineering`.

3.  Mirror-push your bare clone to your new `source-assignment-software-engineering` repository.

    > Replace `<your_username>` with your actual Github username in the url below.

    ```bash
    cd assignment-software-engineering
    git push --mirror git@github.com:<your_username>/source-assignment-software-engineering.git
    ```

4.  Remove the temporary local repository you created in step 1.

    ```bash
    cd ..
    rm -rf assignment-software-engineering
    ```

5.  You can now clone your `source-assignment-software-engineering` repository on your machine (in my case in the `code` folder).

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/source-assignment-software-engineering.git
    ```

However, if you want to go with GitHub WebUI only you can perform the following steps:

1.  [Import this repository into new one](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer). As an old repository use the url to this repository; give it a good name, for example `source-assignment-software-engineering`; choose "Private" under "Privacy".

2.  You can now clone your `source-assignment-software-engineering` repository on your machine.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/source-assignment-software-engineering.git
    ```
